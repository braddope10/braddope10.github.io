As far as difficulty goes this one takes the cake compared to the rest of the projects! We were required to use multiple tables and use a certain amount of several different kinds of relationships, create a joins table, use nested routes throughout the project, include error messages in our froms, learn how to properly use render and render partial, and use omniauth so that the user can log in using a third party account like Facebook or Google.

My project was called "My_Trucking" and I had a lot of fun creating it. Not only because I got to implement my new skills in Ruby on Rails, but I was also inspired to create it because of my father and his line of work. So even during the difficult times throughout the project ( which was around 80% of the time ) I was able to work past it with a smile on my face knowing my project had a purpose beyond Flatiron.

On my project the user is able to create a:

* Truck ( make, color, year )
* Date ( time )
* Broker ( name )
* Job ( start_time, end_time, material, weight, pickup, dropoff, driver, contact_name, contact_number, hourly_rate, po_number )

all in one form and have multiple ways of viewing all of the collected data using the navbar.

That way many truckers that happen to bump into my repo can easily record all of their jobs and much more and forget about their old pen and notebook.
