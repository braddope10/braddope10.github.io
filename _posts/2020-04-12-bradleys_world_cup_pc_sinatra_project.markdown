I finally completed my first solo Sinatra project and I'm excited to say that I felt greatly confident with my skills throught most of the project. There were times where I got lost with my get and post requests and what I wanted my website to actually do, but those tiny issues didn't last very long thankfully. Here are some of the things that I had to learn before creating my project.

* Creating get, post, configure, patch, and delete requests via Sinatra
* Making form tags along with getting used to the contents like action= and method=
* Keeping a password secure with bcrypt
* Using Helper class
* Validating email and password presence and uniqeness
* Writing Ruby scripts within HTML
* Using has_many and belongs_to relationships
* Understaning sessions and what they do
* Practiced using t.integer :user_id for belongs_to relationships
