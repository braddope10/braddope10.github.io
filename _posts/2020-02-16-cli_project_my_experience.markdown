I must admit, though I am sad that I am done with my first big project at Flatiron, there is a bigger part of me that is happy to finally turn it in. These two weeks working on this project have been a great learning experience for me and day by day my confidence is growing stronger. I'm now starting to see some noteable changes in my thought process, knowing that gets me exited for the assignments to come.

Here are some of the things I got a better understanding of along the way:
* Nokogiri
* children
* scraping
* elements.rb
* .gemspec
* cli interfaces
* requiring relatives
* restraining input

I'd say the toughest part of this assignment was finding the location of the correct strings that I wanted using Nokogiri and finding a way to input them in my cli.rb file, but with my cohorts help and a little elbow grease, more like finger grease,  I managed to find the correct ones and now I can put my feet up and relax through Presidents Day knowing I got it done. The pressure has lessened, but it has not gone away. There is a new challenge ahead and I can't wait to test and hone my skills as a Software Engineer.
