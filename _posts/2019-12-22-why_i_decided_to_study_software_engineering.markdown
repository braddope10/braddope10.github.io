The list would never end if I wrote every reason as to why I would like to be a Software Engineer. Given that there are so many, I am only going to talk about the one that is the most important to me.

My happiness. 

My happiness is the biggest pro that pushed me in this decision to study to become a Software Engineer. Being happy with what I am doing allows me to flourish and be passionate about my work. I knew this is what I wanted to be when I started to wonder about the possibilites and heights I would be able to reach with these languages. As a kid, I was always around puzzles and legos. Being able to see every puzzle piece or every lego block as a method in code makes learning new ways and finding new ideas to accomplish the same task make this line of work even more interesting. 

Those types of similarites make coding fun and exciting to me.
