First of all I'd love to say thank you to the staff at Flatiron for the best learning experience I could have asked for! My journey as a software developer has just started, but I definetly feel like I'm ahead of the curve! 

*Now let's talk about my first, but definitely not last, React / Redux Project.*

My project is a loose clone on a dating app. Where users don't have to sign in and keep there information off the internet. They can post and comment on the app.

*My thoughs on React:*

React is what I would call a dream for anyone that is so picky on keeping their work clean and organized.  NPM made it easy to go above and beyond when it came to styling your project because it simply give you so much time to focus on stuff like that.

*Will I use React again?*

Most definitely! React made it possible for me to organize my code in a way that was very easy to read and that made a big difference for me down the strech as I usually get lost when I come back to my code the next day. Rou

*Hindsight is 20/20:*

Looking back I would have gone for a direct approach in cloning an existing dating app as they make new users sign up for a reason. There would have definitley been some age restriction vulnerabilities and misuse of the app with no restrictions on the posts.
